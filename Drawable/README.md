#Drawables
A drawable resource is a general concept for a graphic that can be drawn to the screen. Drawables are used to define shapes, colors, borders, gradients, etc. which can then be applied to views within an Activity.

##Usage
There are at least 17 types of drawables but there are five that are most important to understand:

<ol>
	<li><b>Shape Drawables</b> - Defines a shape with properties such as stroke, fill, and padding</li>
	<li><b>StateList Drawables</b> - Defines a list of drawables to use for different states</li>
	<li><b>LayerList Drawables</b> - Defines a list of drawables group together into a composite result</li>
	<li><b>NinePatch Drawables</b> - A PNG file with stretchable regions to allow proper resizing</li>
	<li><b>Vector Drawables</b> - Defines complex XML-based vector images</li>
</ol>

Let's explore these drawable file types one by one and take a look at examples of usage.
